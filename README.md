> Visualizing the correlation between museums' African collections and the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade

![A screenshot of the visualization. The top half is a bar graph showing the volume of enslaved people that were removed from the African continent by year. The bottom half shows the years object were created that are from the African collections of 5 different art museums.](/african-coll-tast.jpg)

This is a visualization putting these two pieces of data together, using publicly available museums data from a handful of museums. Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade data provided by [slavevoyages.org](http://www.slavevoyages.org/voyage/download)

## Getting Started

All the anonymized musuem data is in a single CSV in [data/collection.csv](blob/master/data/collection.csv). It's a two column file in the format:

| Year | Number of object | 
|------|------------------|
| -100 | 5                |
| 15   | 5                |
| 1993 | 5                |

You can use your own museum's data to create a CSV formatted the same way and replace this file, and visualization will render showing your data in the bottom half.
